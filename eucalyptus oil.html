            <h2>Product History</h2>
            <p>Eucalyptus oil is derived from the leaves of the eucalyptus tree, a native of Australia. It has a long history of use for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Here's a brief overview of the product history of eucalyptus oil:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Traditional Indigenous Use:

                    Indigenous Australian Aboriginal communities have used various species of eucalyptus for centuries. They would crush the leaves and use them for their antiseptic properties, as well as in traditional healing practices.</li>
                <li>Colonial Medicine:

                    By the mid-19th century, eucalyptus oil was being distilled for medicinal use. Surgeon John White was one of the first to publish on the antiseptic properties of eucalyptus oil in 1822.</li>
                <li>Commercial Production:

                    Commercial production of eucalyptus oil began in the 1850s. Joseph Bosisto, an Australian pharmacist, was one of the pioneers in the commercial distillation of eucalyptus oil. He established Bosisto's Eucalyptus Oil in 1852, which is still a prominent brand today.</li>
                <li>Industrial and Household Use:

                    Eucalyptus oil is also used in various industrial applications, such as in cleaning products, as a fragrance in perfumes and soaps, and as a flavoring agent in food and beverages.</li>
